# Description
Extracts the first URL from clipboard content and copies it to the clipboard.

Have you ever copied an image from a Google Doc only to find that pasting it elsewhere doesn't work as expected? The image URL is actually stored in your clipboard, but not in a way that's immediately usable. This extension solves that problem by extracting the image URL from your clipboard and copying it back in a format you can use.

- Extracts the image URL from your clipboard when you copy an image from Google Docs.
- Automatically copies the extracted URL back to your clipboard.
- Ensures that pasting the URL results in the full-size image being accessible.
